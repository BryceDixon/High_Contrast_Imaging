Evolutionary tracks of substellar objects from the "ATMO 2020" model set

Each file contains the evolution of the effective temperature, luminosity, radius and 
gravity of an object, along with absolute photometry in a number of photometric filters 
derived from the atmosphere models. Photometry from the MKO, WISE and Spitzer IRAC filters
are contained within the MKO_WISE_IRAC/ directories. JWST photometry and coronagraphy are 
containied in the JWST_photometry/ and JWST_coronagraphy/ directories.Units are shown in 
the headers of the files.

The atmosphere models are calculated with either equilibrium chemistry or 
non-equilibrium chemistry due to vertical mixing, which alters the predicted 
photometry.  We therefore provide files with photometry derived from the three different 
atmosphere model grids...
  - Files within ATMO_CEQ/ include photometry derived from chemical equilibrium 
    atmosphere models
  - Files within ATMO_NEQ_weak/ include photometry derived from non-equilibirum 
    chemistry atmosphere models with the `weak' mixing relationship
  - Files within ATMO_NEQ_strong/ include photometry derived from non-equilibirum 
    chemistry atmosphere models with the `strong' mixing relationship

The files are named according to the mass of the object in solar masses and the chemistry
used to derive the photometry. For example 0.02_ATMO_NEQ_strong_vega.txt contains the 
evolution of a 0.02M/Msun object with photometry derived from non-equilibrium chemistry
atmosphere models with the `strong' mixing relationship.

More information about these models can be found in Phillips et al. (in press).

Please contact me at mp537@exeter.ac.uk with any questions or requests. Additional 
models or photometry in other filters can be generated to suit demand.
